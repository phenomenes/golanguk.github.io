      about: 
        "We're a supplier of home services (Energy, Telephony, Insurance & Broadband) with around 2% of the UK market, a unique business model and a huge potential to grow.
        <br><br>
        As an established, 20-year-old British company our challenges are to rebuild whilst continuing to innovate and compete, in order to develop a platform to enable the future growth of the business. We have secured the relevant investment to rebuild in house.
        <br><br>
        We truly are unique in our proposition and allow our customers to consolidate payments into a single monthly bill by packaging products and services supplied through a network of wholesale partners. Utility Warehouse is the only genuine multi-utility operator in the market providing products and services to households and businesses nationwide.
        <br><br>
        At the beginning of 2016 we started a fundamental transformation here at Utility Warehouse - driven by the Board, there’s a strong desire to become a modern, agile, UX and tech-led business.
        <br><br>
        Our product and technology teams are a mix of new joiners and company veterans - a lot of the usual practices and processes still need establishing so it's definitely a good time to join and influence how things shape up in the future. Our current stack includes Go, React, GraphQL, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and MongoDB.
        <br><br>
        There's plenty of exciting things to happen here over the next 3-5 years; we have the plan and the budget to make it a good ride."
